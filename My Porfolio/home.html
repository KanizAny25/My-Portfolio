    <h1>Home </h1>
    <p> Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.
         I'am Kaniz Fatema Any.I'am  a Student.</p><br></br>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
             There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
              I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, 
            I like to laugh.</p>
